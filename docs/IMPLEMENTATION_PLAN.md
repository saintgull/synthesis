# Vibe Engine Implementation Plan

## Song Recommendation System

### Phase 1: Create Song Database
- [ ] Build JSON file with 20-30 diverse songs
- [ ] Include attributes for each song: energy, tempo, brightness, warmth, texture
- [ ] Add preview URLs, album art links, artist info
- [ ] Organize songs into categories for easier browsing
- [ ] Implement initial song matching algorithm based on vibe parameters

### Phase 2: Build Recommendation UI
- [ ] Design song recommendation panel layout
- [ ] Create responsive grid/list for displaying matches
- [ ] Build song card component with album art and details
- [ ] Implement audio player for previewing songs
- [ ] Add sorting options (by match score, artist, etc.)
- [ ] Create smooth transitions for updating recommendations when vibe changes

### Phase 3: Backend Integration (Optional)
- [ ] Set up Express server for handling API requests
- [ ] Create endpoint for song recommendations
- [ ] Add caching for performance
- [ ] Consider Spotify API integration for expanded library
- [ ] Add analytics to track popular vibe-song combinations

## Image Generation System

### Phase 1: Setup and Planning
- [ ] Choose Stable Diffusion API provider (Replicate, Hugging Face)
- [ ] Create account and obtain API key
- [ ] Design prompt construction system based on vibe parameters
- [ ] Plan rate limiting strategy
- [ ] Estimate API usage costs and set appropriate limits

### Phase 2: Backend Implementation
- [ ] Set up secure environment for API key storage
- [ ] Create API endpoint for image generation requests
- [ ] Implement prompt engineering based on vibe state
- [ ] Build rate limiting mechanism (10-20 generations per hour)
- [ ] Add error handling for API failures
- [ ] Set up image storage/caching to reduce duplicate requests

### Phase 3: Frontend Implementation
- [ ] Design image generation section in UI
- [ ] Create "Generate Image" button in vibe controls
- [ ] Design and implement spinning star loading animation
- [ ] Build image display component with proper sizing/scaling
- [ ] Add download functionality for generated images
- [ ] Implement "Save to Collection" feature
- [ ] Develop gallery view for saved images
- [ ] Add ability to reload saved vibes from gallery

## UI Enhancements

### Phase 1: Core Interface Updates
- [ ] Reorganize layout to accommodate new features
- [ ] Create tabbed interface for different media recommendation types
- [ ] Design responsive layouts for various screen sizes
- [ ] Update color scheme to match new direction
- [ ] Improve slider interactivity

### Phase 2: User Experience Improvements
- [ ] Add tooltips explaining vibe parameters
- [ ] Create onboarding experience for new users
- [ ] Implement keyboard shortcuts for common actions
- [ ] Add sharing functionality for vibes and generated content
- [ ] Implement local storage for user preferences
- [ ] Create export/import system for vibe presets

## Development & Infrastructure

### Phase 1: Development Environment
- [ ] Set up Node.js development environment
- [ ] Install necessary dependencies (Express, CORS, dotenv, etc.)
- [ ] Configure development server with hot-reloading
- [ ] Create .env file structure for API keys
- [ ] Set up version control workflow

### Phase 2: Testing
- [ ] Create test cases for song matching algorithm
- [ ] Test image generation with various parameter combinations
- [ ] Test rate limiting functionality
- [ ] Perform cross-browser compatibility testing
- [ ] Mobile/responsive design testing

### Phase 3: Deployment
- [ ] Choose hosting service for backend (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
- [ ] Set up production environment variables
- [ ] Configure CORS for security
- [ ] Deploy backend API
- [ ] Deploy frontend application
- [ ] Set up monitoring for API usage
- [ ] Create backup/restore system for user data

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Start with the song database:
   - Create JSON structure for song metadata
   - Add sample of 10 songs with complete attributes
   - Write basic matching algorithm

2. Begin design work:
   - Sketch layout for recommendation panels
   - Design song card component
   - Create initial mockup of image generation section

3. Implement core functionality:
   - Build song recommendation function that works with local data
   - Create basic UI for displaying recommendations
   - Develop structure for image generation component
